tell me a joke,Did you hear about the hungry clock? He went back four seconds.
what are nutritional values?,"A person needs around 2,0000 calories per day but that ranges based on age, sex, and weight. Additionally, a person should intake daily fats, sodium, saturates, and sugar a person which is 44-77 g, 2.3 g, 16-22 g, and 50 g respectively. FSA Lights can health understand these nutritional values as each value is assigned with a color depending on how healthy the food is. A person should also be exercising for 30 minutes to an hour per day which CHARLIE calculates when finding a fitness plan.
FSA Lights are used to determine if a food is healthy through different colors. Fats, salts, saturates, and sugars all have FSA lights. The more green the FSA Lights are, the healthier the food. The average amount of daily calroies, fats, sodium, saturates, and sugar a person will eat is 2,000 cals, 44-77 g, 2.3 g, 16-22 g, and 50 g respectively."
